        <td><p>Year after year, many apes must survive in the jungle with only their wits and cunning. But their homes are being destroyed by humans intent on clearing jungles. Something must be done. By sending us items, we will deliver them to the apes. Whether that be food or tools, the apes will appreciate your contribution. We at Arm the Apes believe that the apes should have a chance to use our inventions, improving their quality of life while allowing us to further examine how the apes react to human creations. These fascinating creatures deserve your material possessions, nothing bad shall come of this!</p></td>
        <td><p>Our founder, Dr. Hugh Mann, believes that anyone should be able to pitch in when it comes to helping apes and help them recover from the damage caused by deforestation. By providing the apes with food and other miscellaneous items, these apes will receive some sort of compensation for all the forests that have been destroyed.</p></td></tr></table>
